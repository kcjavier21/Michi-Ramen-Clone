        content: `The Michi story is a wild ride to say the least. When we started in 2012 with a food truck,
        we couldn't have imagined being named the best Ramen in Austin by our fans two short years later.
        In a town long dominated by enchiladas and burgers, we've loved introducing Austinites and Texans to our favorite food.`
